    "- Milestone project 2 of [this udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/lecture/9497646#overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are the game details (simplified version of the actual blackjack game):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a standard deck of **52** cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 4 suits: Clubs, Spades, Diamonds, Hearts; 13 cards each.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2 players: `Computer Dealer` (Dealer) and `Human Player` (Player).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initially,\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Dealer has one card face up and one card face down.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Player has two cards face up.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The player goes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The player places some bet amount. If the player loses, the bet amount goes to the dealers. If the player wins, he receives a prize of twice his original bet amount.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The goal of the player is to get closer to a sum of 21 before the dealer does.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The player has 2 permitted actions:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Hit:** Takes a card from the deck.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Stay:** Finishes his turn.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Dealer's turn:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If the player's value is less than 21, dealer hits until he beats the player or he busts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If the player's value is more than 21, player loses and dealer gets all his bet money.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Dealer wins if dealer's sum is less than 21 and is more the player's score.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Dealer busts when his sum is greater than 21, in that case, human wins and his prize money is double of his bet amount, which gets deposited into his account.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Here are some additional considerations:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Jack, Queen, King have a value of 10.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Ace can be either 1 or 11, depending on the player's choice at that moment."
